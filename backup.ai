Write some python code. Use functions if code gets larger than 20 lines.
problem statement = I want to backup a given folder that contains sources. 
Idea is to be able to back up entire folder (including ignored like .git and invisible_starts_with_dot files)
OR all visible_non_ignored files 
OR just the files that have uncomitted changes.
provide placeholders for locating files. I will do that manually 
also write some unit tests with pytest
provide a wrapper for shell command executions (where I can copy paste a command), handle error conditions and timeouts
add requirements.txt if any libraries are needed. I will use pip later
further provide a README.md that I can paste into existing version 
all these files will be written into a zip whose name should be constructed like so:
dirname__parentdirname__timestamp.zip for today, substitute dirname = foldername (no path)
parentdirname = foldername of the parent directory (no path)
timestamp = 2digit for years, 3 letters for current month in english + 2 digits for zero-padded today's date. 
__ = separator
So today = 21 April 2025, timestamp = 25apr21
use argparse for CLI options
please ask any followup questions if needed
